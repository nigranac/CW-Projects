      Taksim Square is the most known modern city center of Istanbul. Many
      hotels and restaurants are in or near the Square and on Istiklal Streets,
      and there is a local bus terminal for public transportation and the main
      subway station. Istiklal pedestrian street has many bars, night clubs and
      movie theaters therefore it's always busy with young people almost for 24
      hours a day. The Square is also the meeting place to celebrate New Year's
      Eve, parades, public concerts and other shows. The most important monument
      in Taksim Square is the Independence Monument (Istiklal Aniti in Turkish),
      standing at the beginning of Istiklal pedestrian street. This is also the
      turnaround point for the old tram which is the only vehicle permitted on
      Istiklal Street besidcde official (police and government) cars. The monument
      was made by the Italian sculptor Pietro Canonica and opened in 1928, it
      describes Atatürk, founder of the Republic, as a military
      commander-in-chief and a statesman. Since it's opening, the monument
      became the center spot of official ceremonie in Istanbul. On its south
      façade overlooking the Siraselviler Street, there is Atatürk, Ismet Inönü
      and Fevzi Çakmak in the front and other figures behind them, including two
      Russian generals. On the north façade overlooking at Cumhuriyet Street,
      the War of Independence is symbolized. On the east and west façades, the
      Turkish Army is symbolized with a soldier holding the Turkish Flag. Across
      this monument on the other side of the Square, there is a huge building
      which is Atatürk Cultural Center. In the early years of the Republic, an
      opera building was started to build which was completed after a long
      construction period of 13 years. It was opened with the name of Istanbul
      Cultural Palace in 1969 but suffered a great damage because of a fire in
      1970.
